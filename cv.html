				<p>My background is in Geographic Information Systems and web development. The unifying thread through my professional background is my desire to build tools that have an impact. At the Duke University Library I helped to make digital library resources more accessible. In my work at the Children's Environmental Health Initiative I created maps and web applications that enabled people to better understand public health issues. For my Master's project I built a tool to foster local communities through maps. And in my current position I am working toward providing individuals and institutions with an information gateway for savings products.</p>
				<p> I have used a variety of tools and languages including Python, PHP, XML, Django, Drupal, Wordpress, Postgres, MySql, Linux and others. I am also well versed in the complete development cycle from user needs assessments, writing use cases, wireframing, prototyping, implementation and assessment. My coursework in Information Science has given me a solid theoretical understanding of human computer interaction, user interface design and systems analysis, all of which have helped me tremendously as a developer. </p>
